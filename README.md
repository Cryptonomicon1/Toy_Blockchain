This is just a proof of concept distributed peer to peer network of nodes that push to a blockchain when one of them recieves data to push. The nodes each save a copy of the blockchain. There are no security features. This is just a toy to help me understand the core algorithm of distributed blockchains.

I may come back and add security features and miners later.
